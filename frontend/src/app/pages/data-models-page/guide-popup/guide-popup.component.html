        <p>Welcome! Here's a quick guide to using this data model visualizer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Yellow-highlighted nodes</span> can be
            double-clicked to set them as the new root.
            Use the breadcrumb at the top-left of the chart to view the current root or navigate back to previous nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable or disable the chart's zoom functionality as needed:
            <ul>
              <li>Zoom is ideal for shallow or less deeply nested trees.</li>
              <li>Disabling zoom is better for more complex, deeply nested trees.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Search for specific variables or groups using the search icon. You can also filter variables by type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selecting a group sets it as the new root.
            Selecting a variable sets its parent group as the root.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the tree depth by selecting a value from the dropdown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the dropdowns above to select federations and data models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Download data by clicking the "Download" button on the right.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Explore and have fun!</p>
