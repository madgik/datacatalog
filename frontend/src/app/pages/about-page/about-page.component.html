    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The Medical Informatics Platform (MIP) is the most advanced, fully
      operational, open-source platform for sharing decentralized clinical
      data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinical data that cannot be shared, transferred, and stored in a
      centralized way can be federated and collaboratively analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data Owners have full control of accessibility and sharing of their data
      through a tightly controlled accreditation, access control, and user
      management system.
    </p>
    <p>
